                      Jony Ive was born on February 27, in Chingford, London.
                      Ive was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age. Ives
                      father allowed him to go to his workshop as a Christmas
                      present and design as well as create whatever he wanted
                      to. Design has been with Ive essentially his whole life.

                      Ive went to Chingford Foundation School and Walton High

                      Ive went on to begin his first job with Tangerin, a
                      startup design company in London. Ive designed a toliet,
                      bidet, and sink, but his design was rejected. Ive didn't
                      like when people disliked his work, so he resigned. Ive
                      was later recruited to Apple when Steve Jobs was planning
                      to return. Ives first design being the Imac was a huge
                      success. He later went on to design the Iphone and Ipad as
                      well.
